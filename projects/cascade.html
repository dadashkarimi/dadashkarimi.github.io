<p>This project implements a <strong>hybrid 3D, multi-scale model for fetal brain extraction</strong> from MRI scans using a <em>cascade of U-Net architectures</em>. Leveraging a Breadth-Fine Search (BFS) and Deep-Focused Sliding Window (DFS) approach, our framework achieves precise segmentation results in full-uterus stack-of-slices scans, even with limited training data and annotations.</p>

<p>Our method employs a cascade of four models—<strong>A, B, C, and D</strong>—trained to focus on 3D patches of decreasing sizes from a synthesized set of training images augmented with random geometric shapes. At inference, we pool sliding-window predictions across multiple sizes to detect and refine the region of interest (ROI) that most likely contains the fetal brain. Subsequently, we derive an accurate brain mask through voxel-wise majority voting.</p>

<h3>Pipeline Overview</h3>
<p>In the <strong>Breadth-Fine Search</strong> stage, Models A and D generate probability maps \( P_A \) and \( P_D \) across the full input volume \( I \), producing a coarse brain mask from the largest connected components across maps. We then perform a bounding box fit on this mask to extract the 3D ROI \( R \subset I \).</p>

<p>In the <strong>Deep-Focused Sliding Window</strong> stage, Models B, C, and D progressively refine \( R \) through sliding-window passes, each stage narrowing the ROI and updating a binary mask \( S_{final} \) via majority voting across maps \( S_B, S_C, \) and \( S_D \), leading to an optimized fetal brain mask with minimized false positives.</p>

<p>Training includes generating synthetic shapes surrounding the brain label map to enhance the model's performance. This augmentation technique is illustrated below:</p>

<p>Key advantages of this model include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Improved detection:</strong> Efficiently identifies brain regions in low-contrast MRI scans.</li>
    <li><strong>Adaptability:</strong> Performs well on scans with sparse or limited annotations.</li>
    <li><strong>Precision across resolutions:</strong> High and low-resolution sliding windows systematically refine segmentation.</li>
</ul>
