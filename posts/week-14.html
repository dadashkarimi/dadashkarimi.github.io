<p>Let‚Äôs not bury the lede: I quit my job. After 8 years of working there, Google feels like a very different
company than the one I joined, one that aligns less and less with my values, and it was time to move on.
It sucks, because my immediate team was a group of wonderful people who do great work; I will miss them,
and the work I did, greatly. I haven‚Äôt had a vacation longer than 2 weeks since I was 18-ish, because I worked every summer and was too much of a naive workaholic to think I should take more than 1 week between jobs, so I am giving myself 6 months before I start something new this time around. It‚Äôs stressful to not have a plan, and I am bad at relaxing, but I have full confidence I can learn to overachieve at this as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Didn‚Äôt I tell y‚Äôall I was worried SOMETHING was going to happen and I wasn‚Äôt going to get my vaccine? Here I am, 3 hours before my J+J stabbie stabby, reading about how my appointment is cancelled because it has an incredibly rare clotting side effect. One that is 10000 more rare than the usual clots women get threatened with for taking birth control and that absolutely nobody blinks an eye at anymore. This feels a lot like fabricated concern; we already don‚Äôt care about women getting blood clots. 1 in over 6 million? Fam, that‚Äôs better odds than getting in a car or not getting e-coli from Chipotle. Stop this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I‚Äôve become very bad at telling stories, which is 100% a result of the panini and not being forced to socialize with people. I‚Äôve noticed several times in recent weeks where I‚Äôm telling a story and can see the life leaving from people‚Äôs eyes. I am bored of what I am saying as I am saying it. I am not ready to move to the midwest yet; I must fix this.</p>
</li>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Danez_Smif/status/1381449712428060672?s=20">This</a> is a very good tweet. Abolish the police already. Stop giving guns to insecure people who think a uniform gives them the right to kill others because of the colour of their skin. Stop giving guns to incompetent people who apparently aren‚Äôt trained enough to tell the difference between a gun and a taser, but are confident they have a right to use either. Stop giving guns to people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am working on 2 linocuts. I should probably start working on more generative stuff, since JavaScript is my bread and butter and should somehow prove to my future employers I still got it. Or something. I am a deflated balloon after finding out my vaccine was cancelled and writing about yet another dead black man above so I don‚Äôt really know how to end this update on a good note.</p>
