<p>You can tell I hate writing year in reviews because this one is really, really
late. I tend to hate bragging, and I definitely hate introspective and, in
particular, I always think I am underperforming (and that‚Äôs fine). However, that‚Äôs usually not true,
and writing a year in review forces me to see the awesome things I did, so even if I did end up
underperforming, at least I can learn from that. That‚Äôs the whole point of post-mortems,
right?</p>
<p>As usual, here‚Äôs life as GitHub saw it. Red text is projects I‚Äôve shipped, black text is
conferences I‚Äôve spoken at. Technically I didn‚Äôt speak at Blinkon, but I spoke
<em>to</em> people at it so hey, counting it.</p>
<p><img alt="2017 contribution graph with project and conferences markers" src="../../images/2017-review/github.png" /></p>
<p>The reason why this post mortem is important to me is that before writing it,
I literally thought this year was bad and I just ‚Äúdid fewer things‚Äù. But that‚Äôs
not actually true!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I wrote less code than in 2016 (2713 vs 3153 contributions), but that‚Äôs totally
irrelevant? GitHub contributions are a fake idea, and I‚Äôm the first one
to tell you this, so I don‚Äôt know why I get worked up about them every year. I contributed
to weird branches (which don‚Äôt get counted), and did a lot of weird explorations that
obviously never got merged. I planned things. I wrote design documents. I reviewed
design documents. I formed strong opinions. I learnt Redux. Eat it, contributions graph.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I gave fewer talks than in 2016 (7 vs 8), but I enjoyed conferences more. I went
to a conference where I only hung out with badass women. I went to Railscamp, where
I had no wifi and canoed and wore a headlamp like a giant dork. I MC-ed Chrome Dev Summit
with Mariko, which was scary, and intimidating and incredibly fun.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I built more side projects (10 vs 9). One of them got
featured in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/20/15331050/party-parrot-tweet-monica-dinculescu-terminal-self-care-github">The Verge</a>!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I worked fewer weekends (16 vs 28 days. Goal: 0). And I don‚Äôt mean on <em>work-work</em>,
I mean, <em>at all</em>. On the weekends I play Stardew Valley, or make pottery,
or knit, or watch an entire season of Riverdale <em>because I can</em>. Maybe this means
I‚Äôll work on fewer side-things, and maybe this will hurt my career, but it will keep me happier, not burnt out, and less likely to murder my partner. And that‚Äôs p important.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I joined the Unicode Emoji committee. YES. Really. It took me a year of emails,
and even now I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm the least useful member out of the whole bunch,
but that‚Äôs ok, because I can get better!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I became broadly aware of a lot of technical things, but not necessarily
<em>deeply</em> aware of them. I am really confident I understand Web Components, emoji and web fonts
<em>really well</em>, but I still don‚Äôt really know how any of our polyfills work, or
how to fix a sizeable bug in Polymer, or what to do
about async/await and stuff. In the last couple of months of the year
I started learning more about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http/2 push</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">link rel=preload</code>, but I feel
it‚Äôs a broad sort of understanding. I don‚Äôt know yet what kind of person I want to
be: ‚ÄúI understand something <em>really</em> well in all its intimate aspects which makes me an expert‚Äù, or
‚ÄúI understand many things well enough to have opinions and advice, but not well
enough to be an expert in any of them‚Äù. This is the thing I want to figure out this year.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I learnt how to skateboard. I saw one of my favourite bands in concert.
I ordered a coffee entirely in Japanese. I learnt how to
make mugs and bowls and bottles, with my hands. I made new friends, and I didn‚Äôt piss off any
of my current ones (that I know of). I nuzzled dogs, and cats, and an otter.
I still didn‚Äôt spoil Star Wars. I turned 32.</p>
<p><img alt="2017 instagram top nine" src="../../images/2017-review/instagram.png" /></p>
<p>I don‚Äôt do resolutions because they don‚Äôt really work for me, but I heard a
good one from a coworker: do 12 <strong>new</strong> things next year.</p>
<p>So, I will.</p>
