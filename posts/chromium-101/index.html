<p>I gave a talk about how to get started contributing to Chromium, but it wasn’t recorded,
and my <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/notwaldorf/contributing-to-chromium">slides</a> by themselves look like cold-medicine induced hallucinations
(which, to be fair, they were). So instead, here is a giant blog post that will take you
through every step from “checking out the code” to “landing the code in the Chromium repo”. It will also come in super handy for mild to moderate cases of insomnia.</p>
<p>If you just want a TL;DR or a refresher of the commands you might need, check out the <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/notwaldorf/contributing-to-chromium">slides</a>. They’re basically bullet points without the running commentary.</p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong>: this is a long post. The bug we’re fixing is silly, but will get
us writing actual Chromium code. If you want a
real good-first-bug to fix after this, <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?q=Hotlist:GoodFirstBug">here</a> is a nice list. Usually unassigned bugs (with no owner) are free for the taking, but it can also happen that a bug will be assigned to a human who is not actually working on it. Check the activity on it – if there haven’t been any activities in a while, leave a message on the bug or ping the owner and tell them you’d like to work on it!</p>
<h2 id="get-your-computer-ready">Get your computer ready</h2>
<p>Chrome is giant. It needs a beefy machine (we recommend a 64-bit OS, with at least 8GB of RAM. A separate SSD to hold/build your code will make your life infinitely more pleasant), and a couple dozen goat sacrifices. Even then, building Chromium from scratch is slow. Snails run the half mile faster (fact). This is something you might as well get used to.</p>
<p>We have a pretty solid set of <a href="http://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/get-the-code">instructions</a> on
how to get everything set up. I promise you this page has been used and reviewed a billion times, it’s up to date,
and every step in it is important. Don’t skip steps because you think you don’t need them. You do.</p>
<p>However, I’ll tell you about the custom <a href="https://github.com/notwaldorf/.not-quite-dotfiles/blob/master/zsh/chrome">things</a> that I use that <em>aren’t</em> on that page, which I’m pretty proud of.</p>
<ul>
<li>I always build <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Release</code> builds, because they’re faster. This means I don’t get as many debug symbols as I would like. That’s fine for me, because I’m a chicken
and pretty scared of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lldb</code>, and I debug with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">printfs</code> like this is the 80s anyway</li>
<li><del>I’ve added <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">component=shared_library</code> (so that incremental builds are super fast) and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dcheck_always_on=1</code> (so that even though I have
a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Release</code> build, debug asserts still get hit) to my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GYP_DEFINES</code>. <a href="http://www.chromium.org/developers/gyp-environment-variables">Here</a> are all the ways in which you can set up your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GYP_DEFINES</code>. I use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chromium.gyp_env</code> way on Windows (because I don’t understand <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PATH</code> variables) and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Environment Variable</code> way on Mac/Linux, because I sort of understand <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exports</code>. Realtalk, I really don’t know any Windows, and I’m ok with that</del>. Chromium switched to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gn</code>; check <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/mac_build_instructions.md#Faster-builds">this</a> out for how to enable the component build with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gn</code>. The bit about me not knowing any Windows is still true, though.</li>
<li>I have a fancy set of <a href="https://github.com/notwaldorf/.not-quite-dotfiles/blob/master/zsh/chrome#L15">aliases</a> like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make_</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">go_</code>, so that I don’t have to
remember about which flags I want to run Chrome with. They come in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">doskey</code> variants on Windows</li>
<li>Don’t use cygwin on Windows. It doesn’t play nice with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">depot_tools</code></li>
<li>I use Atom, and have used Sublime as an editor. Last time I checked, XCode beach balled, huffing and puffing, when trying to load the code. Visual Studio works pretty well if you can stand Windows and its insane command prompt. You can use ctags if you want; I don’t. I use a dumb editor, and find code through
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git grep</code> and the Chromium <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch">codesearch</a>, because I’m metal like that. You can use anything you want. Literally nobody cares.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Edit</strong> (Aug 9, 2016): Chromium just switched to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gn</code>, which means some of the comments below don’t apply. Check these <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/mac_build_instructions.md">mac build instructions</a> for how to make your build fast again, using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gn</code>.
<strong>Edit</strong> (Feb 17, 2016): I wrote a detailed <a href="https://github.com/notwaldorf/ama/issues/34#issuecomment-185038702">answer</a> that contains a whole bunch of extra tricks to make builds faster.</p>
<h2 id="get-your-body-ready">Get your body ready</h2>
<p>Chromium has a <a href="http://www.chromium.org/developers/coding-style">code style</a>. Do
not panic if your first review will have 20 comments that are code style nits. It’s
absolutely normal, and nobody thinks less of you. On the contrary, we try to be
extra picky with new people, so that they learn everything as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Chromium is hard. I’ve been working on it for two years, and it’s still hard.
There’s a loooot of code, and you’ll spend a fair bit of time looking for the right
bit of code you care about. Don’t be afraid to ask questions if you’re stuck. It took me <em>forever</em> not to be scared of asking questions, but it turns out all the
people that told me that everyone is nice and helpful were right: everyone IS nice
and helpful, because at some point they were you, the code was as scary then as it is now, and the compiler has never stopped barfing errors since the day it was born.</p>
<ul>
<li>IRC: there’s a <a href="http://echelog.com/logs/browse/chromium">#chromium</a> room for dev-related questions. It’s a bit of a zombieland outside of PST hours</li>
<li>mailing list: <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!forum/chromium-dev"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="7d1e150f12101408105019180b3d1a12121a1118531e1210">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. I strongly recommend to search the archives before you ask a new question. A lot of common things have been asked, and people tend to get a bit grumpy if you ask “how do I get infinite quota translate API keys” for literally the thousandth time</li>
<li>if you’re still stuck and panicked, email <a href="../../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#e789888a94a7848f95888a8e928ac9889580">me</a>. I might not know the answer, and I might be super busy, but I promise to be nice and help in whichever way I can. Gifs of animals doing silly things are encouraged</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="omg-lets-write-some-code">OMG let’s write some code!</h2>
<p>We’re going to add a button to Chrome. It’s going to be the best thing ever (second to a freshly opened can of Pringles). For realsies. It will be in this bubble here, and it will open [redacted] (2019 update: I let that URL expire and now it apparently points to nsfw things so uhhhh don’t click it.) in a new tab. This is the before and after:</p>
<p><img tabindex="0" width="656" src="../../images/chromium/before_after.png" alt="The before image has 2 buttons in the Chrome profile menu, 'switch person' and 'go incognito'. The after image has a third button, 'Can I have a pony?', with a star icon, that has been inserted above the other 2 buttons." /></p>
<p>(side note: if you don’t see that button in your dev build of Chromium, launch it with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--enable-new-avatar-menu</code>. The UI is enabled by default on all of the released Chromes through a server side flag, but that bit of magic doesn’t run on dev builds, so you need to turn it on yourself)</p>
<p>I chose this dialog because the easiest way to find your way through code is for there to be a searchable string in there like “Switch Person”. Also I wrote this bubble, so it’s Pretty Clutch™.</p>
<h4 id="0-make-a-branch">0. Make a branch</h4>
<p>First things first: <em>always</em> create a new branch for every bug/feature/bit of code you’re working on. Working directly
on the master branch is bad news bears: 1) it’s very unlikely you’re working on one thing at a time, 2) pulling new code from the remote master to your local repo becomes an adventure. .<strong>TL; DR</strong>: don’t work on master evar. So,</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(´ ▽｀).。ｏ♡ src on master ❥ git checkout -b add-pony-button origin/master
Branch add-pony-button set up to track remote branch master from origin by rebasing.
Switched to a new branch 'add-pony-button'
(´ ▽｀).。ｏ♡ src on add-pony-button ❥
</code></pre></div></div>
<h4 id="1-find-the-code">1. Find the code</h4>
<p>Hooman, meet <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch">codesearch</a>. It’s your best friend in Chromium. It knows where all the codes are and who they’re called by, and where interfaces get implemented. I spend so much time with it, I’ll probably send it a Valentine’s Day card this year. Anyway, search for “Switch Person” in there, and get these results</p>
<p><a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#search/&amp;q=%22switch%20person%22&amp;sq=package:chromium&amp;type=cs"><img width="656" src="../../images/chromium/codesearch_1.png" alt="The search gives two results, described below" /></a></p>
<p>First, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">generated_resources.grd</code> is where most of the
strings in Chrome live. A giant file makes
internationalization sooper easy – you hand out the file to translators, they
give you back the same file in a different language, and at startup, Chrome
decides which file to load based on its locale. Bingo bango, localized UI.</p>
<p>Some of the results have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ACCESSIBLE_NAME</code> in them, which means that they’re accessibility strings (hint: they’re read out loud by VoiceOver apps). <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IDS_PROFILES_SWITCH_USERS_BUTTON</code> looks promising though, so let’s see where it’s used.</p>
<p><a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#search/&amp;q=IDS_PROFILES_SWITCH_USERS_BUTTON&amp;sq=package:chromium&amp;type=cs"><img width="656" src="../../images/chromium/codesearch_2.png" alt="The files that are relevant and appear in the search are 'profile_chooser_view.cc' and 'profile_chooser_controller.mm'" /></a></p>
<p>Aside from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">generated_resources.grd</code> results from before, we have <em>two</em> new files!</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chrome/browser/ui/views/profiles/profile_chooser_view.cc</code> – This is in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ui</code>
subfolder, which means it’s a UI related file (good sign), so probably a dialog or a bubble. On
top of that, it’s a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.cc</code> file in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">views</code> folder, which means it’s Windows/Linux code</li>
<li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chrome/browser/ui/cocoa/profiles/profile_chooser_controller.mm</code> – The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.mm</code> is
a dead give-away this is a Mac UI file. On OSX we write our UI in Objective-C and drink a lot of wine to forget</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m doing this demo on the Mac, so let’s look at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">profile_chooser_controller.mm</code>. I’ve
written both of these files, so I promise you they’re SUPER similar.</p>
<h4 id="2-adding-a-button">2. Adding a button</h4>
<p>Ok, so now I’m looking at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">profile_chooser_controller.mm</code> and here’s how my brain would start nomming this code: that string ID is used in a button that
lives in a method called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-createOptionsViewWithRect:</code>. This method is called by
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-buildProfileChooserView:</code>, which in turn is called by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-initMenuContentsWithView:</code>. You
can go down this rabbit hole for days, but the basic idea is that this is clearly the place where we draw buttons in this bubble.</p>
<p>If we look at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-createOptionsViewWithRect:</code> in particular, it
does the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>creates a drawing rectangle that’s of a fixed width and fixed height. This is the
size of each of those buttons. If you’re not familiar with Cocoa (who can blame you),
the way this works is that we draw everything in
relative coordinates. We’re basically going to keep this rectangle fixed, and just
change the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y</code> coordinate at which we’re drawing. Also: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y=0</code> is the bottom of the screen,
and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y=a billion</code> is the top of the screen, and we always draw bottom to top.
Say it with me, “because Cocoa”.</li>
<li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-hoverButtonWithRect:</code> is a utility function that draws a fancy button with a text,
an image, and an action selector (that’s Cocoa-speak for “click handler”)</li>
<li>If we’re allowed to display the lock button, it creates and draws <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lockButton</code>.
Spoilers: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">displayLock</code> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">false</code> unless you do some Chrome gymnastics I honestly don’t recommend, because they’re way less fun than they sound</li>
<li>If we’re allowed to display the incognito button (we are), create and draw it</li>
<li>Finally, create and draw a button whose string is “Exit Guest” if we’re a Guest session, or “Switch person” otherwise</li>
<li>Did you see how we drew everything bottom to top? Yeah. That’s a thing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hey! We should do the same thing! Let’s add our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ponyButton</code> right below the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">switchUsersButton</code> (which, again, means it’s being drawn above it ARE YOU HAVING FUN YET???). The highlighted bits are the new code.</p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/notwaldorf/9dda1a00709cc24a5b02#file-1-creating-a-pony-button-mm"><img width="656" src="../../images/chromium/code_button.png" alt="Code showing how to instantiate a pony button" /></a></p>
<p>The code we just wrote says that when you click on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ponyButton</code>, we call a method called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-goPoniesGo:</code>. We should probably write it, so that we can actually test our code. It will only log something to the console for now, because logging code is the best code.</p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/notwaldorf/9dda1a00709cc24a5b02#file-2-adding-the-go-ponies-go-handler-mm"><img width="656" src="../../images/chromium/pony_code_1.png" alt="Code showing how to create the click handler, and add a logging statement to it" /></a></p>
<p>If you build and run this, your bubble should look like the “after” image described before,
and clicking the button should spew things on the console.</p>
<h4 id="3-making-the-button-go">3. Making the button go</h4>
<p>This bit is a leap of faith. We want to open a URL in a new tab, but we don’t
really know how. If you search for things like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">open in new tab</code>, you can hope
to hit some comments, but <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tabs</code> are kind of like the prom queen of the browser so you’re going to get a crap load of useless results. Unfortunately for us, I know that we’re looking for a method called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chrome::ShowSingletonTab</code> (in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chrome/browser/ui/singleton_tabs.cc</code>). Had I not known this, I think I would have found it, for example, by checking how the
“Settings” item in the hot dog menu (or hamburger menu, call it whatever food you wish) opens the “chrome://settings” tab. It will take some digging.</p>
<p>If you don’t know how to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ShowSingletonTab()</code>, I would <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">codesearch</code> again for different
uses of the function. This time, just by looking at the method signature, we
can figure out we should write:</p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/notwaldorf/9dda1a00709cc24a5b02#file-3-implementing-the-go-ponies-go-handler-mm"><img width="656" src="../../images/chromium/pony_code_2.png" alt="Code showing how to add a line to the click handler to open a new tab" /></a></p>
<p>Because the stars aligned and Mercury wasn’t in retrograde, we had all
of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.h</code> header files already included for this to work. Compile it, run it, and get a pony!</p>
<h2 id="send-your-code-for-review">Send your code for review</h2>
<p>I don’t know about you, but I’m preeeeeeetty proud of this feature, so I feel we’re ready to send it for review!
Run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit -am "added pony button"</code> to commit this file, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git cl upload</code> to upload it to <a href="https://codereview.chromium.org/">codereview</a>.</p>
<p>In your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git cl upload</code> message, write a meaningful description, a crbug ID, and a blurb about how to
test this. This is what I would write:</p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/notwaldorf/9dda1a00709cc24a5b02#file-4-sample-cl-description-text"><img width="656" src="../../images/chromium/cl_description.png" alt="Sample CL description. It has a title which is less than 72 characters, a summary, a crbug id, and detailed testing instructions" /></a></p>
<p>And if that goes well, this is what your CL (stands for change-list. Comes from the dark days of Perforce) should look like on the site! (that CL doesn’t exist anymore, but here’s a <a href="https://codereview.chromium.org/1042923003/">random</a> CL as an example)</p>
<p><a href="https://codereview.chromium.org/1042923003/"><img width="656" src="../../images/chromium/codereview_1.png" alt="Sample CL as it renders on codereview" /></a></p>
<p>If you want to test that your CL didn’t break anything, run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git cl try</code>. This will look at what your code touches and run a whole bunch of tests on a whole bunch of platforms.</p>
<p>In Chromium, code lands only after it’s been <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LGTM-ed</code>, which means that someone has reviewed it and gave you the thumbs up. If you don’t know to whom to send it for review, pick someone
from your file’s OWNERS. In this case, look at the OWNERS file in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chrome/browser/ui/cocoa</code>. Owners are people who are responsible for the code,
so they tend to know it best. If they’re too busy for a review or aren’t
entirely familiar with your particular part of the code, they can direct you to
a better reviewer.</p>
<p>(Side note: please don’t <em>actually</em> send this pony code out for review. People will be very confused, and not necessarily amused.)</p>
<h2 id="ship-it-squirrel-">Ship it, squirrel! <img class="emoji" title=":shipit:" alt=":shipit:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/shipit.png" height="30" width="30" /></h2>
<p>When your CL is reviewed and ready to go, all you have to do is check the “Commit” checkbox, and the commit-queue bots will take care of it. This means that they will run a whole bunch of unit tests again, and if they all pass (or “come up green”), merge your code into the current master branch.</p>
<h4 id="oh-noes-trouble">Oh noes, TROUBLE</h4>
<p>Sometimes, something goes wrong (or even better, horribly wrong). Your bots could come up red, and then you’ll
get an email from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">commit-bot</code> telling you your CL couldn’t land, because you done bungled some tests. This is totally fine – you didn’t break anything yet, because your code wasn’t merged.
Either your tests are actually broken, or some code got committed before you
and you need to rebase, or maybe you’ve just encountered a flaky test and don’t need to do anything. You can go back to your CL, fix your tests, and re-check the
“Commit” box.</p>
<p>Sometimes you’ll even get to break the tree. I recently tried to land a change
where all my bots were green and as soon as the change landed, it broke 165 tests on each bot. Suuuup.</p>
<p>It happens. You can revert your CL if you realize this in time, or that day’s sheriff might do it for you (especially if you’re an external committer, aren’t on IRC, etc). In this case, be nice to the sheriff and apologize a bit. Maybe send them a gif. Remember: if you’re stuck, ask for help!</p>
<h2 id="good-first-bugs">Good first bugs</h2>
<p>We have a <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=2&amp;q=Hotlist%3DGoodFirstBug+&amp;colspec=ID+Pri+M+Cr+Status+Owner+Summary+OS+Modified&amp;x=m&amp;y=releaseblock&amp;cells=tiles">list</a> of bugs deemed as “good starter bugs”. Sometimes they’re more complicated that we thought, so don’t panic if that’s the case. It’s not you, it’s Chrome :). Protip: in the statuses, “Assigned” with a name in the owner means someone is actually looking at that issue, so it’s probably not a great one to pick.</p>
<h2 id="your-turn">Your turn!</h2>
<p>That’s it! That’s how you commit code to Chromium! Good luck, and if you do end up landing a CL, send me an <a href="../../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#741a1b190734171c061b191d01195a1b0613">email</a> or a <a href="https://twitter.com/notwaldorf">tweet</a>. I’d love to see it!</p>
