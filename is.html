<p>In 2021 I ended an 8 year adventure as a Senior Engineer at Google. Since then,
I've been working with companies on creative projects, prototyping, or advising
their engineering teams. Some of the bigger companies I've worked with (that I can talk about)
include Google, <a href="https://gorevel.com/">Revel</a> and
<a href="https://www.modernatx.com/en-US">Moderna</a>.
</p>
<p>My last project before quitting Google was <a href="http://magenta.tensorflow.org">Magenta</a>
-- making music and art with Machine Learning; I built the majority of the
users-and-model interactions, such as <a href="https://glitch.com/@magenta">these ones</a>.
Here's the <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lyEjtKQAAAAJ&hl=en">publications</a>
I was on during that time.</p>
<p>In 2020 I did a 6 month fellowship
with the <a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/">Trevor project</a>, where I lead a team
that worked on classifying suicidal ideation posts on a social media platform.</p>
<p>Prior to 2018, I worked on <a href="https://polymer-project.org">Polymer</a>,
and was a big advocate for Web Components in both the open source and standards communities.
I maintained and owned one of the first (and at the time, largest!)
<a href="https://www.webcomponents.org/collection/PolymerElements/paper-elements">suite</a> of
custom elements. During this time I was also a member of the Emoji subcommittee, which
is a career high <span class="og">üòÉ </span>.
</p>
<p>
Before that, I used to work on
<a href="http://www.chromium.org/">Chrome</a>. Do you know that little profile switcher button that
in top right corner
of your browser? Yeah, I did that (but now it looks different.
It's been 6+ years after all). Before <i>that</i>, in the prehistoric times, I worked in finance, despite
not really understanding or caring about it. I have a masters in Computer Science
from <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/">McGill University</a>. I wrote a thesis on Reinforcement Learning,
which you can read <a href="includes/mdinculescu_thesis.pdf">here</a>, though I'm not sure why you would.
<p>I've recently started focusing less on tech and more on art, which is something I've wanted to do all my
life! You can see how that is going on my <a href="https://meownica.studio">studio page</a>.
</p>
<h3><span class="og">‚ú® </span> Do you want us to work together?</h3>
<p>I am available for freelance work in a <b>consulting</b> capacity (not as a full-time engineer), or as a tech advisor
for your company. My areas of tech expertise are the web platform, creative
applications and interactions, and usable machine learning. I care deeply about users,
performance, accessibility, and having things be functional. I am especially interested in (creative)
projects
that help people create things, public sector organizations and non profits. I have absolutely
no interest in anything related to crypto, the block chain, or most areas of finance.</p>
<p>If you'd like us to
work together, check out the ways in which I can <a href="work.html">help your company</a>.</p>
</p>
<h3><span class="og">‚òéÔ∏é </span> Do you want to just say hi?</h3>
<p><s>My social media hell of choice used to be <a href="https://twitter.com/notwaldorf">Twitter</a>,
which I've abandoned since its muskification. </s>
I also have a GitHub AMA <a href="https://github.com/notwaldorf/ama">repo</a>
where you can ask me things, or read what other people have asked me.
If you really need to, you can send me an <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#513c35383f32243d3422322411363c30383d7f323e3c">email</a>,
but know that it'll take me an embarassing time to reply.
It's not you, it's misplaced anxiety.</p>
<h3><span class="og">‚Åâ </span> What are these cute emoji?</h3>
<p>
Why, thank you for asking! They are from the original Docomo emoji set,
from the birth of time (2001). A while back I made
<a href="posts/og-emoji-font/index.html">a font of them</a>, and this year I
decided I hadn't been using them enough.
