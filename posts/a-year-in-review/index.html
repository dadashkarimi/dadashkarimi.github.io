<p>I‚Äôve never really done a year in review. One day, I‚Äôd like to <a href="https://github.com/una/personal-goals">open source</a>
my goals, but since I‚Äôm still a chicken, this is a baby step towards that. Plus, this is
one of the first years I‚Äôm really proud of, and things that you‚Äôre proud of tend
to live on the Internet, for posterity.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs what my GitHub contributions say about it:</p>
<p><img alt="2015 contribution graph" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1369170/12084003/d0f4558a-b261-11e5-84f4-d28e947dd75d.png" /></p>
<h2 id="burning-out">Burning out</h2>
<p>The year started off really poorly. My team had just shipped the new Profiles
UI in Chrome, after a year and a half of hard work, and it was met with a looooot
of Internet anger. On one side we had data to prove that the change we did was right, which made
the powers that be want to stick by it; on the other side I had Twitter,
who was calling me names and wanting me fired. Kind of ironic, since
I was just the person who implemented the feature and had no power
to change it.</p>
<p>I think what burnt me out wasn‚Äôt waking up to a stream of negative
emails and tweets, it was knowing that there was absolutely nothing I could do about
it other than wait.</p>
<p>So I started working on dumb side projects to feel better. I made a
<a href="../../meowto/index.html">link aliaser</a>. I bought <a href="http://canihaveapony.com/">dumb</a>
domains. I wrote <a href="../chromium-101/index.html">blog</a> <a href="../chromium-owners.html">posts</a>
about the only thing that I knew, which was working on Chromium.
I noticed that not working on Chromium made me happy.</p>
<p>So I bit the bullet, left Chromium, and joined Polymer.</p>
<h2 id="joining-polymer">Joining Polymer</h2>
<p>Looking back, I picked Polymer for a bunch of silly reasons that ended up working out
spectacularly well. I wanted to leave Montreal. I wanted to work on JavaScript,
since it was the only thing keeping me going. I didn‚Äôt want to commute to Mountain View,
which reduced my options by like a billion percent, and I wanted to ship things.
Polymer had all of that. So on April 15, I packed my cat and my books
and moved to San Francisco.</p>
<p>Polymer is my dream job. I get to write code
that I‚Äôm genuinely passionate about. I get to try to change the web platform, and talk
about why I think we‚Äôre doing the right thing. Most importantly, I get to ship
something everyday. It turns out that‚Äôs a thing that matters to me a lot.</p>
<p>I miss working on Chromium. I miss C++ and the big-ness and complicated-ness
that is working on a browser. It taught me that if I could find my way around
the 7 million lines of code and actually do something useful, there‚Äôs basically
nothing that I can‚Äôt do or learn. That‚Äôs one of the best feelings.</p>
<h2 id="tl-dr">TL; DR.</h2>
<p>I shipped 5 projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../meowto/index.html">meowto</a></li>
<li><a href="../../emoji-translate/index.html">emoji-translate</a></li>
<li><a href="https://caturday-post.herokuapp.com/">caturday post</a></li>
<li><a href="../../emoji-rain.html">emoji-rain</a></li>
<li><a href="../../muster/index.html#6&amp;23">muster</a></li>
<li><a href="../../is-ie10-dead/index.html">is IE10 dead</a></li>
</ul>
<p><br/>
I gave 5 different talks at 3 conferences and 2 meetups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contributing to Chromium, <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/notwaldorf/contributing-to-chromium">slides</a></li>
<li>Push notifications for fun and profit, <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/notwaldorf/push-notifications-for-fun-and-profit-if-by-profit-you-mean-cats">slides</a>, <a href="https://vimeo.com/137771040">video</a></li>
<li>Styling the Shadow DOM without dragons, <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/notwaldorf/styling-the-shadow-dom-without-dragons">slides</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbOaJwqLgog">video</a></li>
<li>Input I &lt;3 you but you‚Äôre bringing me down, <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/notwaldorf/input-i-3-you-but-youre-bringing-me-down">slides</a>, <a href="https://vimeo.com/144980655">video</a></li>
<li>How I didn‚Äôt fix emoji in Chrome, <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/notwaldorf/or-how-i-didnt-fix-emoji-in-chrome">slides</a></li>
</ul>
<p><br/>
I wrote a blog post that a lot of people liked. Most importantly, this happened (#humblebrag):</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I think <a href="https://t.co/eAoYZGWieP">https://t.co/eAoYZGWieP</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/notwaldorf">@notwaldorf</a> may be the best thing I have ever read</p>&mdash; Jeff Atwood (@codinghorror) <a href="https://twitter.com/codinghorror/status/657371215800086529">October 23, 2015</a></blockquote>

<p><br/>
I had my first ever interview, on <a href="https://usesthis.com/interviews/monica.dinculescu/">The Setup</a>. I spoke on my
first ever podcast, <a href="http://hanselminutes.com/499/understanding-web-components-and-polymer-with-monica-dinculescu">Hanselminutes</a>.
I discovered <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/9aW5ZxIrBu">#nailconf</a>, which reassures me I can be both a giant nerd and have pretty nails. I kept
3 succulents alive, accidentally killed one, and resurrected a fig leaf tree. I saw my first live
baseball and basketball games. I bought a second
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/-VIJ05orDH">ukulele</a>. I didn‚Äôt work on weekends. I didn‚Äôt spoil Star Wars for
anybody. I turned 30.</p>

<p>See y‚Äôall next year, internet friends!</p>
